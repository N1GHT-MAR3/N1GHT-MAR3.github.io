Information on this page is subject to change, and we cannot guarantee full game stability yet.","This guide assumes you have a copy of the game. We do not offer download links for the game at this time."]},{"l":"Installing the game","p":["Avoid installing the game to the default directory, if possible. Program Files (x86) is a protected directory that requires administrator privileges to make changes, which can cause incompatibility with many programs.","After the game is installed, uncheck the \"Launch Juiced?\" checkbox. You will most likely not be able to run the game in its current state."]},{"l":"Juiced Config","p":["Run JuicedConfig.exe in the Juiced folder, wherever you installed it to. This will initialize some settings that the game needs to run.","Set your desired resolution (making sure to pick 32-bit color), anti-aliasing level, and whether or not you want windowed mode or widescreen. Bear the following in mind, however:","Resolutions above 1920x1080 are not available in the Config.","Depending on your hardware, the Config may not show all anti-aliasing levels, even if your hardware can handle it. The maximum level the game supports is 8.","If Windowed mode is enabled, the available resolutions will be drastically cut down.","Widescreen scaling is broken for non-16:10 aspect ratios.","All of the above issues are fixable outside Juiced Config, so don't worry if your graphics settings are not perfect.","Once you're done, click OK, then OK to the dialog that appears."]},{"l":"Registry tweaks","p":["To get around the limitations of Juiced Config, we can edit the game's registry keys directly, allowing us to set whatever we want.","Hold the Windows button and press R to bring up the Run dialog.","Type \"regedit\" and press enter, granting administrator privileges if prompted.","Navigate to \"Computer\\HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\THQ\\Juiced\"."]},{"l":"Custom resolution","p":["Set \"RezWidth\" to the width of your desired resolution. (i.e. 1920 for 1920x1080)","Set \"RezHeight\" to the height of your desired resolution. (i.e. 1080 for 1920x1080)","Make sure to set the base to Decimal before inputting the desired value.","Make sure \"RezDepth\" is set to 32."]},{"l":"Full anti-aliiasing","p":["If anti-aliasing level 8 was not available in Juiced Config, you can manually set \"Antialiasing\" to 8."]},{"l":"Change language","p":["You can change the game's language to any of the five supported by changing \"language\" to:","English: 9","French: 1036","German: 7","Italian: 16","Spanish: 10","Make sure to set the base to Decimal before inputting the default value."]}]]
